## UI Update: Blue + Purple Tech Mix Background

Updated the global body styles to feature a Blue + Purple Tech Mix gradient for a vibrant, modern cloud‑engineering feel.

- Background: `linear-gradient(135deg, #3a7bd5, #3a6073)`
- Fixed gradient effect while scrolling
- White text for strong contrast and readability

The page now has a futuristic, next‑gen look — ideal for a Cloud Engineer portfolio.

Suggestion: If the About section looks too simple, consider subtle animations, soft card shadows, or gradient‑highlighted headings to add depth.
